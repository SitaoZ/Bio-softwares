## Cutadapt 
[Cutadapt](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) is a software tool designed to identify and eliminate adapter sequences, primers, poly-A tails, and other undesired sequences from high-throughput sequencing reads.
Cleaning your reads in the manner is frequently necessary due to specific reasons:
 - Small-RNA sequencing reads encompass the 3' sequencing adapter , as the read is longer than the sequenced molecule.
 - Amplicon reads initiate with a primer sequence.
 - Although ploy(A)tails are beneficial for extracting RNA from your sample, they are often unwanted in your reads.
