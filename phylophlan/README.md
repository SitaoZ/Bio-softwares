## PhyloPhlAn

PhyloPhlAn is an integrated pipeline for large-scale phylogenetic profiling of genomes and metagenomes.

Most likely the easiest way to understand how you can use PhyloPhlAn in your analysis is to check out the examples in the PhyloPhlAn [tutorial](https://github.com/biobakery/biobakery/wiki/PhyloPhlAn3).
